# Title

Safe robots that learn

# Abstract

To enable autonomous robots in unstructured environments, we need robots that learn and adapt to the environment. However, online-learning introduces uncertainty which can lead to unsafe behavior, unless accounted for in control of the robot. In this talk I will focus on learning a model of system dynamics online while satisfying safety constraints. Our objective is to avoid offline system identification or hand-specified models and allow a system to safely and autonomously estimate and adapt its own model during operation. Given streaming observations of the system state, we use Bayesian learning to obtain a distribution over the system dynamics. We show that a safe control policy can be synthesized for systems with arbitrary relative degree and probabilistic CLF-CBF constraints by solving a second order cone program (SOCP).
